  * The central issue is that many individuals struggle with manual, inconsistent, or non-existent tracking of their personal finances, leading to a lack of awareness regarding their actual spending habits. This often results in:
  * Budget Overruns: Spending more than they earn without realizing it until it's too late.
  * Poor Savings: Difficulty in setting and meeting financial goals (e.g., saving for a down payment or retirement).
  * No Financial Clarity: Inability to easily identify where their money is actually going (e.g., excessive spending on dining out vs. necessary expenses).
